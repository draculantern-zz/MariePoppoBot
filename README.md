### build
* to build her, install visual studio and set up your system's PATH to include MSVC's wierd compiler setup batch file (for VS2017 it defaults to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\`) for more info go [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line)
* after that, just run `build.bat` and the executable will be written to the bin folder
